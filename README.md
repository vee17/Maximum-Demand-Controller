# Maximum-Demand-Controller
A maximum demand controller (MDC) is generally used in controlling electricity usage (power consumption) thereby saving on electricity cost. It monitors electricity usage and sheds off low priority loads during peak hours.
The controller can:
Connect to at least four different loads.
Measure and display the power consumption of each load and the total power consumption on an LCD/GLCD.
Accept user MDC set point values and store in an external memory for reference and use later.
Accept user input for setting the priority of the loads connected to the MDC.
Shed off the low priority loads when the power consumption is within ten percent of the set point value.
